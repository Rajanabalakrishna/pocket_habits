Of course, here is a concise 10-line version of your project description.

Pocket Habits is an offline-first Habit & Mood Tracker built with Flutter for iOS & Android. It features full CRUD management for habits, including custom weekday schedules and reminders. Users can log their daily mood on a 1-5 scale with an optional note for reflection.

A dedicated stats screen provides insights with a calendar view, streak counter, and charts. Visualize progress with a 7-day habit completion bar chart and a 7-day mood line chart.

The app is 100% offline-functional, with all data securely stored locally using the Hive database. Gentle, on-time reminders are delivered via local notifications, requiring no internet.

It supports both light and dark themes with a focus on a clean, accessible user experience. State is managed efficiently using Riverpod, following the robust Repository Pattern. This project showcases a polished UI, smooth animations, and solid architectural principles.
